# The Stack

## Who is the Stack?

The stack is a "linear data structure" and an "abstract data type". "Abstract data types" are mathematical models for "data types". "Abstract data types" house a shared set of functions and "data types". Abstractly, the stack is a data stucture that follows the, "Last In First Out" linear operation or LIFO.

An example of LIFO, is of a stack of plates. In order to access the bottom plate you must access the plates above it. In order to add a plate to the stack of plates, you must add the plate to the top of the stack. Following suit, in order to remove a plate from the stack, that plate must be at the top of the stack.

The stack is a list made of elements that contain data and the position of those elements called indexes. The positioning of these elements is in relation to when they were added to the list. The removal of any of the elements are also dependent on what the position of the item is in relation to the total length of the list. Each of these actions have a time complexity in Big O notation of O(1), or constant time.

### Questions

1. Question One
   Write out a Program in order to access each element of the Vector. Programmatically leave a comment explaining the steps to acheive what you are doing and why you did it that way.
   Code

2. Question Two
   Write out a Program that does the following

   - Modify the Original Stack. We are directly Modifying the Original Stacks Element Data and returning the Original Stack modified. In each of the Questions make sure to programmatically leave comments on what you are doing and why.

     - Print each element.
       Code
     - Print a specific element.
       Code
     - Add a new Element.
       Code
     - Remove an existing Element.
       Code
     - Edit an existing Element with a Loop.
       Code
     - Edit an existing Element with Functional Programming.
       Code

3. Question Three
   Write out a Program that does the following

   - Clone the Stack. Cloning creates a new stack with Original Stack Data and leaves Original Stack Unmodified. In each of the Questions make sure to programmatically leave comments on what you are doing and why.

     - Print each element.
       Code
     - Print a specific element.
       Code
     - Add a new Element.
       Code
     - Remove an existing Element.
       Code
     - Edit an existing Element with a Loop.
       Code
     - Edit an existing Element with Functional Programming.
